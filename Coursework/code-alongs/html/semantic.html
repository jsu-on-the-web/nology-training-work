        <p>The two biggest programming styles today are <strong>Functional Programming</strong> and <strong>Object
                Oriented
                Programming</strong>. Both have their uses and practicioners of both tend to be very opinionated
            about which is
            better. In this article, we'll be taking a look and the differences between the two styles.</p>

        <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
        <p>Functional programming, as the name suggests, revolve around mathematical functions. A big part of the FP
            ethos is <i>every function should return the same result given the same inputs.</i> It also heavily
            discourages mutability/changing variables' values in order to uphold that ethos.</p>

        <h2>Object Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>Object Oriented Programming is based around compartmentalizing concepts into real life "objects", where the
            inner data is hidden from the user and the objects instead provide a public interface to interact with them.
            Mutability is allowed. It works on the concepts of encapsulation and inheritance.</p>

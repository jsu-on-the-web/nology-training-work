**Challenge: Representing Vehicles with Interfaces**

*MVP*

1. Create a `Vehicle` interface with 2 function signatures

   - `getSpeed` -> returns the speed in `miles/h`

   - `decreaseSpeed` -> decrease speed by `s` `miles/h`

2. Create a Bike class

   - Class must store it’s speed in `km/h`

   - Implement the `Vehicle` interface

3. Create a Car class

   - Class must store it’s speed in `m/s`

   - Implement the `Vehicle` interface

4. Both classes should have constructors that allow you to set the initial speed
5. Both classes must have setters for their attributes
